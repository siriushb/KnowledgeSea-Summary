This is an uncensored version of [deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d) created with abliteration (see [remove-refusals-with-transformers](https://github.com/Sumandora/remove-refusals-with-transformers) to know more about it).  
This is a crude, proof-of-concept implementation to remove refusals from an LLM model without using TransformerLens.

If “<think\>” does not appear or refuses to respond, you can first provide an example to guide, and then ask your question.  
For instance:

```
  How many 'r' characters are there in the word "strawberry"?
```
